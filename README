What's Chopstx?
===============

Chopstx is an RT thread library for STM32F103 (ARM Cortex-M3)
or STM32F0 (ARM Cortex-M0).

While most RTOSes come with many features, drivers, and stacks,
Chopstx just offers a simple RT thread library.

With Chopstx, interrupt handling is also done by a thread.  This
enables coherent code for ease of maintenance.

Example code
============

We have two examples in this distribution, LED blinker and
USB CDC-ACM function.  You can build it like:

   $ cd example-cdc
   $ ln -s ../board/board-olimex-stm32-h103.h board.h
   $ make

For a specific board named FSM-55, an example of LED matrix dynamic
driver is provided.  See the directory: example-fsm-55.


Future Works
============

Convenience function to determine bottom of thread stack, thread local
storage and support of interface like poll/select would be next thing
to be done.
